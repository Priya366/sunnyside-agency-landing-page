## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design 
- A little JavaScript for Hamburgur menu. 

### What I learned

It was my first time using JavaScript as I am still in the learning phase. I used some Html attributes (aria-expanded, data-visible, aria-controls) which were new for me. Overall,it was a good experience with the help of Kewin Powell videos.
